# The SOLID Principles

    S – Single-responsibility Principle
    O – Open-closed Principle
    L – Liskov Substitution Principle
    I – Interface Segregation Principle
    D – Dependency Inversion Principle

Michael Feathers introduced the acronymn

## 1. Single-responsibility Principle

    “There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.”

* A **SINGLE** resonsibility for a class.
* If a class is handling many different responsibilities then 
* Leads to better readability and less complexity.

## 2. Open-closed Principle

    “Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle

    “subtypes must be substitutable for their base types”

* Able to replace/substitue subclasses of a base type without the application crashing.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle

    “Classes that implement interfaces, should not be forced to implement methods they do not use.”
    "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

    “High level modules should not depend on low level modules rather both should depend on abstraction. Abstraction should not depend on details; rather detail should depend on abstraction.”

* **INTERFACES!!**
