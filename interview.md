* **Tell me about your architecture experience within the .NET ecosystem?**
  * Started pre .Net because I hated HTML
    * Not a real language
    * Created Javascript functions and objects to generate HTML for me
    * Started with VB.Net to generate tables, fields, etc. and then the Framework caught up.
  * Wrote code generators starting with C++, VB, Java, .Net
    * Then Microsoft catches up with Entity Framework
  * Written
    * Windows Services
    * Win Forms
    * WPF
    * WCF Services / REST API
    * Web Apps

    * Microsoft's answer to Node?
  * Eventually moving to .Net 5 so everything merges into one framework
* **How long have you been a principle architect?**
  * Since I've started coding back in high school.
  * You research the problem and figure out what kinds of technologies you have to work with.
  * Then implement while talking with your customer
    * Wrote a power fence inventory program in BASIC on an Apple][+
  * At The School of Mines you're given problems to solve
    * Sometimes solo, mostly on teams
  * Even at Intergraph (early 90's), I don't remember an official architect
    * We were just given a problem and we had to solve it.
  * Now there is just more technology to deal with and more choices
    * UI
    * Compute
    * Storage
  * Work with other developers to establish standards
    * Code looks similar and more maintainable
  * Establish solid testing practices
    * Unit tests and some integration tests
    * With code coverage
  * Ideally a CI/CD pipeline
    * Code repository
    * Automated build and deploy
    * Unit tests and code coverage during build
    * Terraform environment, deploy, integration tests, tear down
  * Need to be able to help people when they are stuck
    * Pair programming
    * Code review
    * Lift the team
    * Always learning
  * 40 years researching and solving problems
* **What methodologies have you worked with?**
  * Software Development Methodologies
    * Waterfall
    * Rapid Application Development (RAD)
    * Scrum
    * Agile
    * Lean / Kanban
* **Which do you prefer? Why?**
  * Current is Lean / Kanban
